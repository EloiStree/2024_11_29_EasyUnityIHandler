# 2024_11_29_EasyUnityIHandler

If you want to do quickly some XR without toolboxes, you just want to drag a sphere that interact with IHandler of Unity.

The idea is that.  
  
I now have just a sphere.  
I will add a "gaze" laser as soon as I have time.  

I know they are ton of tool doing just that.
I just need a simple one that I "own" for my code to stay open source.
